def measure_average(detectors, num, delay=None, stream=None):
    """
    Measure an average over a number of shots from a set of detectors

    Parameters
    ----------
    detectors : list
        List of detectors to read

    num : int
        Number of shots to average together

    delay: iterable or scalar, optional
        Time delay between successive readings. See ``bluesky.count`` for more
        details

    stream : AverageStream, optional
        If a plan will call :func:`.measure_average` multiple times, a single
        ``AverageStream`` instance can be created and then passed in on each
        call. This allows other callbacks to subscribe to the averaged data
        stream. If no ``AverageStream`` is provided then one is created for the
        purpose of this function.

    Returns
    -------
    averaged_event : dict
        A dictionary of all the measurements taken from the list of detectors
        averaged for ``num`` shots. The keys follow the same naming convention
        as that will appear in the event documents i.e "{name}_{field}"

    Notes
    -----
    The returned average dictionary will only contain keys for 'number' or
    'array' fields. Field types that can not be averaged such as 'string' will
    be ignored, do not expect them in the output.
